# Equipment

* 9x13in Baking Dish

# Ingredients

* 3 cups cooked white rice
* furikake seasoning

**Salmon Topping**
* 2 6oz cans of salmon, drained
* 1 cup mayonaise
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* salt and pepper to taste

**Musubi Topping**
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp arrowroot powder or equivalent thickener
* 1 can of spam, 1/2in cubes

**Recommended Garnish**
* furikake seasoning
* roasted seasoned seaweed, 2x3in pieces
* sriacha mayo
* avocado, sliced

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450deg F
2. **Make the salmon topping** Mix together salmon, mayonaise, and soysauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
3. **Make the musubi topping** Mix soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and arrowroot powder in a microwave safe cup that leaves at least 3in of clearance (I used a pint jar). Microwave for 15-20 seconds, watch and stop early if it looks like it might bubble over. Mix and check consistency. Repeat heating and mixing until glaze has the consistency of honey. Toss the cubed spam in glaze until evenly coated.
4. **Assemble** Grease the 9x13" baking dish with butter or oil. Spread the white rice evenly along the bottom. Season liberally with furikake seasoning. 
5. **Bake the spam side first** Layer spam mixture on 1/2 of the rice. Tent the other half of rice with foil and bake for 10 minutes.
6. **Bake the salmon side** Remove tent, spread salmon mixture on other half of rice. Return to oven and bake another 10 minutes or until salmon is lightly browned.
7. **Serve** Garnish with furikake, and serve with roasted seaweed, sriracha mayo, and/or avocado.

Additional Notes:
* We like variety, and you can double either topping if you only wanted to make one. 
* Instead of salmon, you can use crab meat, cooked shrimp, tuna or a combination, go nuts

Future experiments:
* Tamagoyaki topping for spam sides
* Butter the rice before assembly, extra umami and hoping it’ll crust on the bottom like tah dig (persian rice).
